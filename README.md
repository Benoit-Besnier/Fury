# Fury
A new media player, used to be a school projet but trying to improve it =)

## What is that ?
Fury is an Alpha Media Player. While doing homework on a WPF application, I get interested in developping a new media player.
With a comptemporary design (Material Design) and a whole set of tools to listen and watch media, Fury will become your new Media Hub on your computer !
A lot of functionnalities are related on network =) Yeah, like Clementine which allow you to listen to a LOT of music online =)

## Technology
Fury will be an WPF application. Nop, I will not build a Linux version, only Windows will be compatible. (What ? iOS ? What's that ?)
Well, if developpement goes well, maybe we will export Fury...

## Informations
Notice that I'm do not really understand the WPF way, but I'll try my best to build a beautifull application, running beautiful code :)
